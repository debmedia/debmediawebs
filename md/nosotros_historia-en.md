### **How did** we get here?

In 2010, three college classmates started making LED turn lights and selling them online.

When acquiring corporate clients such as Banks, Insurance Companies and Service Companies, they discovered their pain points, including long waits and little personalized and inefficient attention. The customer experience in the offices had a long way to go.

**This is how Debmedia was born, a Software company to manage virtual and face-to-face customer service.**

Some time later, and as a result of the fact that, for many companies, adapting to the new habits of their customers with virtual and face-to-face attention was a challenge, **Debmedia incorporated attention by video call and WhatsApp chatbot** so that companies could get the most out of all their channels and offer a omnichannel service
